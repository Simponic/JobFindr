# Team One

#### March 3rd - March 17th
Scrum Master: James Field 

Members: Jake Cogswell, Logan Hunt, Hailey

Each team member commits to working between 15-25 hours on this sprint, at least 60 hours total.

Based on our first sprint retrospective, we are aim to improve on testing our system. We will be writing
testing documents for each component of our application. This will include system testing and any necessary
regression testing.

Our evaluation metric for this sprint will be based on the amount of testing successfully performed by each
member of the team. Everyone should be writing system tests and documenting results.

Our end goal for this sprint is to have the ability to create, assign, and view a job. This will include moving
money around as well. We will also make the site look more appealing.
