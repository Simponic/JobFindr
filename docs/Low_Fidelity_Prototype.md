## Low-Fidelity Prototype

[Here](https://marvelapp.com/prototype/d7ebd46) is the link to our prototype for this stage.

You *should* be able to access it without an account. In the off chance you do have issues pulling it up, please 
email Hailey at a02242676@usu.edu. The link will take you to a login screen, but it should be *our* non-functioning
login screen.

## Prototype Features
This prototype is from the lens of a customer account, but we included features that will be identical if not similar
for other types of accounts. These are the high-priority features we wanted visuals for:
- User Authentication
- Menu Navigation
    - Job Listings (Home Page)
    - Site Details (About)
    - Account Management
    - Contact Page
