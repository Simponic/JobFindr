# Project Name Here

## Project Overview
This project aims to provide a platform for people who perform yard-work (workers) to find jobs in their desired location as well 
as providing a platform for users (customers) who are looking for yard-work to be done on their property to find workers to do the
desired jobs.

This system will allow customers to place jobs for their property and allow workers to accept these jobs with a 10% fee
being taken out of the customers' payment.

## Software Development Process


## Communication Policies, Procedures, and Tools
Discord - This will be the number one tool used for communication outside of class. We will use dicord to discuss each
persons' assignment as well as make plans for when we need to meet in person to help better solve any issues we face.

In Class - Since We have class every Tuesday and Thursday, and we all sit next to each other we can use the time before 
and after class to have scrums where we talk about how the project is going and where we are running into issues and 
where we plan to be by the next class period.

GitHub - This will be where our project is stored so that we can all access it as well as it beiong used for our 
submissions', version control and data tracking.
