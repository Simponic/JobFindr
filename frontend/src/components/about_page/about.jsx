    <div className="w-50">
    <p> JobFind is the app for customers who need lawn care and for workers who are looking for lawn care work. </p>
    <p> Our app is simple to use. Customers can create a job by selecting the service they need (lawn mowing, shoveling, etc.), setting the date and time, and adding any specific instructions. Then, our app will automatically match them with a worker who is available and qualified to do the job. </p>
    <p> Workers love JobFind because it is a great way to find work in their local area. They can see what jobs are available, and they can choose the jobs that they are interested in. </p>
    <p className='fst-italic'> We are not committed to providing a safe and easy way for customers and workers to connect. We do not screen all workers, and we do not provide insurance and payment protection for customers. </p>
